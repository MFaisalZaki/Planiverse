# # We need a successor function that takes a state and an action and returns a new state
# # We need to define a goal state.

# # How the state is defined? 
# # urban geographic elements as nodes and spatial contiguity as edges. 

# # The problem is modelled as:
# # graph to describe the topology of cities in arbitrary forms and formulate urban planning as a sequential decision-making problem on the graph.

# # The problem is formulated as:
# # spatial planning as a sequential decision-making problem on the graph and conduct planning at the topology level instead of geometry.

# # We have an objective metrics.
# # evaluate the efficiency of the spatial layout according to the existing literature on service31, ecology32 and traffic33â€“35, which provide a comprehensive evaluation regarding the accessibility to basic urban services, the coverage of greenness and the efficiency and rationality of the road network.

# # Then the state will be an instance of the graph.

# # Now what the action space looks like:
# # Cartesian product of three sub-spaces, including:
# # 1. what to plan, 
# # 2. where to plan and 
# # 3. how to plan
